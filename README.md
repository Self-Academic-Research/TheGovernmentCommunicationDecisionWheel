# TheGovernmentCommunicationDecisionWheel
Just a representation. Not a full project. 

This project includes a visual representation of the public relations model developed by Brooke Fisher Lui and J. Suzanne Horsley called the Government Communications Decision Wheel.

Some development is needed and will be done later.
